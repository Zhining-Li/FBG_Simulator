This set of MATLAB functions are developed to simulate different types of 1-dimentional FBG. 




User Handbook:

open main.m script to start defining the FBG parameters

sample__...__FBG.m are included for users to get familiar with the codes.


Things to take note:

You could make changes to the pre-processing.m script to alter the plotting window by specifying the range of 
incident wavelengths 

For theories, please refer to the `Report for EUROP.pdf` file.
